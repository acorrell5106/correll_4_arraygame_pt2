	Is your guessing game a game? Why or why not?
My guessing game is a game because you have to overcome an obstacle, in this case guessing a specific number, to win the game. My game also allows you to have more than one guess, so even if you lose the first time, you get another chance to possibly win.
	What would make it better?
Perhaps, instead of guessing a number, you have to guess a phrase or word to make the game more interesting. Or, you can stay with the numbers but only allow a certain ammount of guesses, so there is a definitive losing option/chance.
