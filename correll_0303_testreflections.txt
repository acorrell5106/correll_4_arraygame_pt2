	What did you miss?
I felt like I definently missed the getters and setters portion, as well as the arrays. I also did not understand the prompt at the end, but I tried to answer it to the best of my abilities.
	What could you have done to have been more successful?
If I had studied a bit more, probably even had come to tutoring, I would have been better prepared. However, some of the things still threw me off, even though I did study.
