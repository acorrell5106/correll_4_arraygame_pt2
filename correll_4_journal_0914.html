	<h1>Addison's Journal 0914</h1>
	<p>In your journal, describe the web page and CSS you've been making.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>What does a:hover do? a:hover is the setting in the CSS for the Navigation tags, allowing you to change the color of the text when the mouse hovers over them.</li>
			<li>What are nav, header, and aside? Nav is the navigation tab that allows you to link multiple sites with keywords on your page. Header allows you to change the secondary title for the page, or the title for the paragraph, not the page. Aside is the tag that defines the content to the side, instead of with the rest of the text.</li>
			<li>Why have we gone so fast through them? We went over them quickly because they are the basics and fundamentals of a webpage, and we would be using them often, so we would get practice using them. This would allow us to understand them better and how they work in a webpage.</li>
