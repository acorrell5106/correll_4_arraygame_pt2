I did manage to finish my game with the time given. However, I had to cut out a lot of content to finish this project. One of the things I had to reduce was my map size. I started by creating a very intricate map, which ended up not working because I forgot to add the blocked property. I did not have enough time to redo this whole map over again, so I minimized the map size. Another thing I had to sacrifice was the enemy. I followed along in class on how to add the enemy to the game, but the amount of steps that had to be made to make the enemy deal damage, follow the player, and then have the player deal attacks was just too much for me with the time I had. With this sacrificed, I also got rid of the player's health, as there would were no enemies to deal damage and I did not want to copy the original game with poison. I also got rid of the speed and all of the potions, as the speed seemed redundant for the size of the map, and the potions would end up being too close together with the map size as well. However, with all of these elements eliminated, I was still able to create a decent game by balancing the size of the map with the difficulty by adding a very small time limit. The player still has to find all of the orbs in time, which still adds difficulty to the game. I wish I could have had all of the elements I wanted with this game, but I had to compromise to finish the game on time.
