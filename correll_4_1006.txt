	What are methods?
Methods are smaller programs that can be integrated with the larger program (often with parenthesis), and are used for short references when in a large program as to not have confusion, making the program much neater and simpler.
	What are classes?
Classes are the blueprints of code, as it describes a group of objects, but not a specific object itself. For example, Squirtle is a class of Pokemon, but each Squirtle has its own properties. 
	What is an instance?
Instances are the specific descriptions of a certain object, such as the variables of the object.
	What are class methods?
Class methods are methods that are called upon in a class, such as self.method_name.
