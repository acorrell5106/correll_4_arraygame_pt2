	Make a list of ten problems you have faced when adding orbs to your game:
1. Setting the orb up so it would match the player's coordinates
2. Getting used to the new getters and setters
3. Getting the timeExists to  work (I ended up removing this feature, as my game already has a tight time frame)
4. Having the orb face the direction the player was facing
5. Having the orb do damage to somethng that wasn't an enemy (Which I'm still working on)
6. Having the orb have a certain speed
7. Making the orb change images
8. Making the orb do awesome things (Getting bigger/smaller, etc)
9. Having a boolean work with the orb to determine if the orb was there
10. Having the orb dissapear when the player won/lost
