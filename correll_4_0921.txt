Addison Correll's Journal 0921

	Have you recieved credit for all journals?
Yes, but most of my journals are 95s, making my average to around 96, and I would definently like to bump up that average and aim for a 100. Other than that, everything is fine grade-wise.
	Why is it important that you use the naming convention specified when naming files?
It is important to name your files in a specific way so you, and others, will know whose work it is so they will be able to grade it, or do other things with it.
	What is the command to copy in Linux? To copy all of a directory to the current directory?
The command to copy in Linux is cp, which will identify a file or files and copy them to wherever you specify. So, you type "cp file_name" and then "new_location" to copy a file and send it to wherever you want it.
