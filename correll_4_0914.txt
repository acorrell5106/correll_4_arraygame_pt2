Addison Correll's Journal 0914

	How would you explain the importance of organizing one's thoughts and not proceeding in a haphazard manner?
I believe that it is important to organize one's own thoughts because not trying to figure things out for yourself and just asking for someone else's codes is not going to help you in the long run, especially when it comes time when you can't ask anybody for anything at all.
If you don't at least try and solve it yourself and to dig around in your own thoughts and knowledge, then you would not have really learned anything. If you have a legitimate question about something you are really not sure about, then it is ok to ask a partner, but when 
all you ask for is their code, you are not using your own knowledge, and you are not able to properly use your skills.
