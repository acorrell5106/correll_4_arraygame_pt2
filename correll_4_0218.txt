	Explain this code:
This code sets up the spritesheet for the player class and also all of the frames for the character's movement.
	Why would it be unrealistic/unproductive to memorize Slick syntax - what are the skills we are trying to practice?
It would be unrealistic to memorize Slick syntax because we are trying to learn to solve problems through the basic knowledge we have, and not through our memorization of a certain syntax.
	What is an array?
An array is a list of things, whether it be ints or Strings.
	How do you make an array? Give an example,
To make an array, you would write either int[] or String[], then the name of the array, then you would write = new int[]String[];. However, you could just fill in what the array is, such as = {"Hello", "World", "!"};.
	What is an ArrayList?
An ArrayList is like an array, but unlike the array, the ArrayList can have more things added to the list instead of having a static amount of things in the list.
	How do you make an ArrayList?
To make an ArrayList, you would write ArrayList<int/String> obj = new ArrayList<int/String>();.
	What are some useful ArrayList methods that you identified?
Some of the methods I saw that were useful were add and remove. Add will add another variable to the list, and subtract will take one away.
	What is the difference between an array and an ArrayList?
The ArrayList can have more things added to the list instead of having a static amount of things in the list, like an array.
	How could we make a health counter for an avatar?
To make a health counter for an avatar, we could have an array or an ArrayList that has numbers 1-100, and then we could count that number down everytime the player loses health, by calling upon the list with the specific number.
