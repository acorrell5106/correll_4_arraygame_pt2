                <h3>The Documentary of Me</h3>
                <p>My name is Addison Correll and I am 14 years old. I was born on February 21, even though I was supposed to be born on Valentine's Day. However, February 21 is national Sherlock Holmes day, which I think is pretty cool. I was born here in San Antonio, TX, and I have only moved once in my entire life, and the house was only about 100 feet away from my previous abode. I guess this is how I became a homebody, and definently an introvert, because all I want to do is spend all day at home. However, I somehow managed to be somewhat social in situations that called for it, such as school. Therefore, I was never truly a loner, yet I felt I never had any true friends. I also guess this is how my love for cats began, since I believe I am the human equivalent of a cat. We both like to be social, but only for a certain amount of time, and sleep was always the priority. I have had four cats in my life so far, and I plan to have more. Anyway, back on topic. I went to Windcrest Elementary School, and this is where I started realizing how important my education was going to be. I joined GT, and have never left. I knew that I wanted to have the same challenge for as long as possible. I then attended Kreuger Middle School's KSAT program, making new friends and improving my skills. I, again, knew I wanted a challenge, so I joined DATA at Roosevelt High School. I don't know why I enjoy challenges, since I have pretty bad anxiety issues, but I just could never stand normal school, normal classes. I like to know that I can ensure my future career now that I have taken on these challenges already.</p>
