	How successful were you with your game?
I was slightly successful at creating my game. The largest difficulty I faced was deciding how much to do with the time I was given. I had to delete lots of code and components of my game to be able to complete some portion of the fiction.
	In what way? Be specific.
I could not fulfill the whole of my game with the time I was given. I understood how all of the components would work, but I could not successfully manage the game with the time alloted. However, I feel as if what I have does flow well into each section, and the mechanics are sturdy, even though they are much more simplified than I was hoping them to be.
