	What does the code below do?
The code below creates a 2D char array with 9 rows and 9 columns called map. It then assigns 'x' to several different places in the 2D array. The first for loop starts counting the
length of map's row with int i, and the second starts counting the length of map's columns with int j. Then, if j is less than the length of the column, than it will either print out 
a period or an x, depending if it finds an x or not in the array. However, if j is not less than the column, then it will move down a line, starting the next i for its for loop, 
and will then place either a period or an x where i and j are at, depending if they find an x or not in the array. 
	How could you make it print an 'X'? What array values would you change?
If I wanted to print an 'X', I would have to change the locations of the characters on the array. So, instead of having an 'x' be located on map[2][3], 
I would have the change the values in the square brackets to something that would resemble an 'X' using all of the characters and their locations.
	How could you use this to make a 5 in a row game?
To make a 5 in a row game, you could have it so you could choose where the character's coordinates would be in game, and then have a for loop that would check and see 
if there are a certain number of characters in a row.
