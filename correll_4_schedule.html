                <h3>What Are The Classes I Have To Take?</h3>
        </article>
		<ol>
                        <li>Class 1: World Studies - This class is a hybrid of English and World Geography, making the work twice as difficult. I am not the best when it comes to Geopgraphy, especially World Geography (I barely knew where a fourth of our states were located), but I'm decent when it comes to English. Sadly, I'm not a huge fan of either class, so it won't be gaining a stop in my list of favorite classes any time soon.</li>
                        <li>Class 2: Orchestra - I have been playing the violin for about four years now, so this class was essential in my Freshman year of High School. I really enjoy the class, as well as our instructor, and I'm glad that I still get to be taught something new everyday, despite four years already under my belt.</li>
                        <li>Class 3: German I - I wasn't quiet sure what language I was going to take in High School, mainly because there were no languages that I had a reason to know, besides just knowing them. I felt that German would seem the most interesting, yet I heard rumors of how difficult learning German could be. However, I am very glad I picked German because I have an amazing teacher who does a very good job of making sure we understand, so I am never lost. I am looking forward to continuing the class next year as well.</li>
                        <li>Class 4: Computer Science Pre-AP - This was the class I was most excited to take this year, mainly because my dream is to become either a software developer or game developer. I wasn't dissapointed with what I recieved in this class, such as how to problem solve and how to work with the command line.</li>
                        <li>Class 5: Web Design</li>
                        <li>Class 6: Geometry Pre-AP</li>
                        <li>Class 7: Physics Pre-AP</li>
                </ol>
