	Were you successful? Why or why not?
I feel as though I was successful with the game because I managed to create a working game with a story that was unique to me. However, I had to change my game a lot and I had to cut it down to be able to finish it, and I was hoping to accomplish much more. However, I am still proud of my game, even if it was not what I imagined it to be.
