Addison Correll's Journal 1109

	Are you ready to begin coding your game?
I believe I am ready to start coding my game, I just need to finish the gritty details of my story to feel confident in how it plays out.
	Why or why not?
I am ready because I have almost the whole story finished, so I just need to convert the story into code for others to play.
	What will be your biggest challenges?
I think my biggest challenges will be coding the game to be as smooth as possible, and having to be able to alter my story if needed.
	Why?
These will be my biggest challenges because I want the game to run smoothly and to make sense to the player, and improvising on the spot isn't my best skill, even though I don't think that I wiil need to do that.
