	What is a class constructor?
A class constructor is a sort of method that is used in a class to prepare an object to be created, as well as giving the object specific values, such as position (x and y) and perhaps its hitbox.
	What should be included in a class constructor for orbs? Why?
The class constructor for the orb would have to include the x and y coordinates of the orb, and the hitbox and image of the orb. We need these so the orb has some sort of location, a hitbox that can be interacted with, and an image that will represent the object.
	What methods should the orb have? Why?
The orb should have the class constructor as a method because this method is basically what creates the object itself.
