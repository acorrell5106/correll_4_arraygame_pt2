	How do you add an image to a slick game?
To add an image to a slick game, you have to include the line (Image ___ = new Image("file location");), including the name of the image and the file path to the said picture. You put this code in a specific class that will use the image somewhere in the game.
	Where is the image drawn?
The image is drawn in the (public void render) class, where the class is called and the image is drawn if the class meets certain requirements. For example: (o.currentImage.draw(o.x, o.y);).
