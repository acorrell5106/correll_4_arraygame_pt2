	What is the purpose of the code art that you create?
I believe the purpose of our code art was to learn more about methods and classes and how we can use them to create anything we want to, whether it's through text/numbers or, in this case, art. I definently learned a lot through this process, and I feel like I could do something like this again with the knowledge I have obtained.
